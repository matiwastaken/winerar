# 🍷 Winerar  
## Version: 1.1 (Beta)  

### ⚠️ Important: Run as Administrator!  
Winerar requires **administrator privileges** to function properly.  

### 🛠 Why does it need admin access?  
Winerar interacts with **WinRAR files** stored in the `Program Files` directory, which is a protected system location. Running the program without administrator privileges may result in errors or limited functionality.  

To ensure everything works as expected, **right-click the executable** and select **"Run as administrator"** when launching Winerar.
